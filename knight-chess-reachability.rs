* Project: Knight chess board reachability
*
* Brief Description: This program creats a matrix of Square objects. These objects are used to house information
*                    in the form of tuples detailing the path a knight takes as it moves across the board. I use
*                    an approach similar to the one seen in Savitch's Theorem, where we alternate taking a single
*                    move forward from the start with a single move backwards from the end. This helps to reduce
*                    the number of possible paths to check, and allows us to just watch for the first time when 
*                    the backward movement path hits a forward movement path, or vise versa. That first touch is
*                    our minimum path!
*
* UPDATE: This program will now allow functionality for a chess board that contains pieces blocking the knight's movement.
*         The general algorithm will remain the same, except that we will have instances where the knight will be unable to
*         complete the desired path.
*
* A note on chess notation: Chess boards are labeled with the top left corner being ("a", 8), and the bottom left
*                           as ("h", 1), and thus this program uses that labeling convention for in/output.
